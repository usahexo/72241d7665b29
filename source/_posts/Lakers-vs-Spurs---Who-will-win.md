#  Lakers vs Spurs - Who will win?

This is a question that has been asked countless times over the years, with both teams having their fair share of successes and failures. However, with both teams looking stronger than ever this season, the answer to this question is far from clear.

The Lakers have been one of the best teams in the NBA this season, thanks to the impressive play of LeBron James. The Spurs, on the other hand, have been solid but not spectacular, which has them ranked 4th in the Western Conference.

That said, the Spurs do have a few advantages over the Lakers. Firstly, they have more experience in big games - something that could come in handy in a playoff series. Secondly, they are much better defensively than the Lakers, which could be crucial if the series goes to seven games.

Ultimately, it's going to be fascinating to see these two teams go head-to-head in the playoffs. While I think the Lakers will ultimately win the series, I wouldn't be surprised if the Spurs pull off an upset.

#  Manchester United vs Liverpool - Red or Blue?

The rivalry between Manchester United and Liverpool is one of the most fiercely contested in world football. The two clubs are separated by only 45 miles, but the animosity between their fans is palpable.

Manchester United are often labelled as the 'Red Devils', while Liverpool supporters are known as the 'Scouse'. The rivalry between these two clubs is largely based on geography and sectarianism, as both clubs have large numbers of supporters from Catholic and Protestant backgrounds respectively.

As well as this, both clubs have won multiple trophies and boast some of the biggest names in world football. So, who do you support - Red or Blue?

#  Mayweather vs McGregor - The Bets are on!

The biggest fight of the year is just around the corner and people are placing their bets! Floyd Mayweather Jr. is a professional boxer who has never lost a fight. Conor McGregor is a mixed martial artist who has never boxed before. So who will win?

It's hard to say, but the odds are in Mayweather's favor. He is undefeated and considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. McGregor doesn't have the same experience or training as Mayweather, so it's likely he will lose. However, that doesn't mean McGregor can't pull off an upset!

This fight is sure to be exciting. It's a battle between two very different styles of fighting and promises to be a close match. Whether you're betting on Mayweather or McGregor, make sure you're ready for an exciting fight!

#  World Cup 2018 - England to Win it All?

After a very successful World Cup qualifying campaign, England are one of the favourites to win the World Cup in Russia this summer. Gareth Southgate has built a young and forward-thinking squad, with some of the country’s most promising young players getting their chance to shine on the world stage.

England have never won the World Cup, but this could be their year. Here are five reasons why they could lift the trophy in Moscow in July:

1) The current generation is inexperienced but talented

England’s squad contains few experienced players, but this could actually be a positive. The likes of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard have all played plenty of games for their clubs but have minimal caps for their country. This means that they will be keen to impress and prove themselves on the biggest stage of all.

2) They have a good mix of youth and experience

In addition to the youthful exuberance mentioned above, England also have some older heads in their side. Players like Jordan Henderson and Gary Cahill have plenty of top-level international experience, and they will be crucial in helping to guide the younger players through what is sure to be a tough tournament.

3) They are playing relaxed football under Southgate

Under previous managers, England were often criticised for playing too defensively and being too afraid to take risks. However, that changed when Gareth Southgate took over as manager. Under his guidance, England play an attractive and possession-based style of football which should suit them well at the World Cup.

4) They have a favourable draw

England were drawn in Group G alongside Belgium, Panama and Tunisia. While all three teams will provide tough opposition, England should still be able to progress from the group stage. In particular, their match against Belgium is likely to be decisive – whoever wins that game will likely top the group.

#  Super Bowl LII - Eagles vs Patriots

The two best teams in the NFL will battle it out at the Super Bowl this year, as the Philadelphia Eagles take on the New England Patriots.

The Eagles were one of the surprise packages of the NFL this season, making it all the way to the Super Bowl despite being considered underdogs by many. They will be looking to upset the odds and pull off a shock victory over the Patriots, who are looking to win their sixth Super Bowl title.

The Patriots are clear favourites to win this game, but they will not be taking the Eagles lightly. The Eagles have proved that they can compete with anyone in the NFL, and they will give the Patriots a stern test on Sunday.

Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have been together for 17 years now, and they have won five Super Bowl titles together. This could be their sixth title together if they can come out on top on Sunday.

The Eagles have a number of dangerous players on offence, including quarterback Nick Foles, wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and running back Jay Ajayi. The Patriots will need to be wary of these players if they want to come away with a victory.

Rob Gronkowski is one player who could cause problems for the Eagles defence. The tight end has been in excellent form this season, and he could cause havoc for Philadelphia's defence on Sunday.

This is sure to be an exciting game, and it is difficult to pick a winner. However, I am going to side with the Patriots in this one. They have been more consistent throughout the season, and I think they will just about edge out an impressive Eagles side in what should be a close contest.
