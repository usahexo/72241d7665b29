#  MGM National Harbor Casino Opens: Minimum Blackjack Bet is $10

The new MGM National Harbor casino in Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C. opened its doors on December 8th. The $1.4 billion casino is the sixth in the state and the largest one in terms of square footage. The minimum blackjack bet is $10 and table minimums generally range from $15 to $25.

The casino features 3,600 slots and video poker machines, 171 table games, a high-limit gaming area, and a 31-table poker room. Restaurants include celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson's Ruffian steakhouse, David Chang's Momofuku CCDC ramen restaurant, Michael Mina's Fish tail restaurant, and an array of fast food options. There is also a 3,000-seat theater for concerts and events.

The casino has been controversial because it received public funding as part of a deal with the state to build a new convention center in Prince George's County. The county has seen significant economic development since the casino opened and there are now fears that the casino will suck away business from other casinos in the state.

For those who enjoy gambling, MGM National Harbor offers a great alternative to the casinos closer to Baltimore and D.C. With table minimums starting at just $10, it's a great place to start out if you're new to gambling or if you're on a budget.

#  How to Play Blackjack at the MGM National Harbor Casino

If you're looking to try your luck at blackjack, the MGM National Harbor Casino is the place to be. You can find blackjack tables scattered throughout the casino, with stakes starting at just $5 per hand.

The basics of blackjack are simple: you try to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards, or by making the dealer go bust. However, there's more to the game than just that, and if you want to make the most of your time at the casino, it's important to understand some of the more advanced concepts.

In this article, we'll give you a crash course in blackjack strategy, and teach you how to make the most of your money while playing. So read on, and get ready to hit the tables!

The first thing you need to know is that blackjack is a game of odds. The odds always favor the house, but by using basic strategy, you can reduce the house edge down to just 0.5%. This means that for every $100 you wager, you can expect to lose an average of 50 cents.

However, even with basic strategy, there's still a chance that you'll lose money while playing blackjack. That's why it's important to set yourself a budget and stick to it. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose.

Now that we've covered the basics, let's take a look at some of the more advanced concepts in blackjack strategy.

One such concept is card counting. Card counting is a technique that allows players to gain an advantage over the casino by tracking which cards have been played. By keeping track of which cards are left in the deck, card counters can make informed decisions about when to bet big and when to fold their hands.

Card counting is a difficult skill to master, and requires a lot of practice if you want to be successful at it. However, even if you don't want to learn how to count cards, there are still things you can do to improve your chances of winning.

For example, one trick is called "the surrender." This involves giving up half your bet when your hand is not looking good early on in order to minimize losses. Another trick is called "insurance," which is essentially a side bet that pays out 2-1 if the dealer has blackjack. By knowing when and where to use these tricks, you can increase your chances of walking away from the table a winner.
