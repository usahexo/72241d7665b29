How to Play

The China Shores slot machine is a five reel, 30 payline game with a Chinese theme. The aim of the game is to match up three or more symbols on any of the paylines in order to win a payout. The amount you can win depends on the symbol combination, and some symbols offer bigger payouts than others.

To play, first choose how many lines you want to bet on (one through 30) and then choose your bet per line amount. You can bet anywhere from 1c per line up to $10 per line. Once you have chosen your bets, hit the spin button to start spinning the reels. If you prefer, you can also use the autoplay function to automatically spin the reels for a set number of spins.

Bonus Features

The China Shores slot machine offers two bonus features – the free spins bonus and the pick bonus. The free spins bonus is activated when three or more scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels. This will award 10 free spins which can be retriggered if more scatter symbols appear during the free spins round. The pick bonus is activated when three or more bonus symbols appear on an active payline. During this bonus round, you will be presented with 12 tiles, each containing a different cash prize amount. Your task is to select as many tiles as possible until you reveal 3 matching amounts which will be your payout for that round.

Advanced Strategies

Now that we have covered the basics of how to play China Shores, let’s take a look at some advanced strategies that can help improve your chances of winning:


#1 – Choose Your Bets Wisely
One of the most important things to remember when playing any slot machine is to choose your bets wisely. Don’t just bet blindly on every payline – instead, only bet on those lines where you think there is potential for a payout. Likewise, don’t bet too high or too low – find a betting amount that suits your budget and stick with it throughout the session. This will help increase your chances of walking away with some profits from your play session!

#2 – Keep an Eye Out for Winning Symbols As we mentioned earlier, not all symbols offer equal payouts in China Shores. The golden dragon symbol, for example, offers significantly higher payouts than other symbols such as flowers or lanterns. So, if you are looking for slots with high potential payouts, keep an eye out for these golden dragon symbols!

#3 – Use Bonus Rounds Wisely Bonus rounds offer players great opportunities for large payouts if they are played correctly. However, they can also lead to big losses if players make poor choices during these rounds. So before entering into any bonus rounds, take some time to study what options are available so that you can make informed decisions about how best to proceed and maximise your payout potential!
