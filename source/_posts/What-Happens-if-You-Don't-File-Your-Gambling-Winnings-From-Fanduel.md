#  What Happens if You Don't File Your Gambling Winnings From Fanduel?

It’s important to understand gambling tax law and how to correctly report your gambling income. If you don’t, you could end up owing the IRS a lot of money.

The first step is to determine if your gambling winnings are taxable. Winnings from most types of gambling activities are taxable, with a few exceptions. This includes winning money from betting on horses, dog races, and other sporting events, as well as playing casino games and poker.

However, there are some things you can do to reduce the amount of tax you owe on your gambling winnings. For example, you can deduct your losses from your taxable winnings. You can also claim the standard deduction on your tax return instead of itemizing deductions.

If you do have to pay taxes on your gambling winnings, the amount you owe will depend on how much money you won. The tax rate for gambling income is typically 28%. However, it may be higher if your income is above a certain level.

In order to file your gambling winnings correctly, you need to know what type of form to use. For most people, Form 1040 will be the right form. You will report your total taxable gambling winnings on line 21 of Form 1040. You will also need to report any deductions you claimed on Schedule A (Form 1040), such as losses from gambling activities.

If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income, it’s best to talk to a tax professional.
