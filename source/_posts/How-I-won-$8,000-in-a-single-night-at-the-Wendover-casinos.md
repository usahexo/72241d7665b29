#  How I won $8,000 in a single night at the Wendover casinos

In early 2017, I found myself in Wendover, Nevada for a weekend of fun at the casinos. After playing for a few hours on Friday evening, I had racked up about $4,000 in losses. I was not happy about this, but I decided to continue playing and see if I could win it back.

I ended up winning back all of my money and then some. In total, I won $8,000 from the Wendover casinos on that one night. How did I do it? Here’s what I did:

1) Started with small bets: When you are first starting out at a new casino or table, it is best to start with small bets. This will help you to get comfortable with the game and the other players at the table. If you start betting big right away, you could find yourself quickly out of money.

2) Changed tables often: Another key to winning at the casino is to move around frequently. By switching tables, you can get a better understanding of different games and also different players’ tendencies. This will help you make better decisions when it comes time to bet.

3) Stayed disciplined: One of the most important things when gambling is to stay disciplined. If you start getting too aggressive or greedy, you are likely to lose everything that you have won. Stick to your original plan and don’t let emotions get the best of you.

4) Used proper strategy: Lastly, using proper strategy is key when trying to win at the casino. There are various strategies that can be used depending on the game that you are playing, so be sure to do your research before sitting down at a table.

Follow these tips and you too can win big at the Wendover casinos!

#  How to play blackjack and other table games to win at Wendover

There are few casino games as exhilarating as blackjack. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going bust. At Wendover, we offer a range of blackjack tables to cater for all budgets and players. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, read on for our tips on how to play blackjack like a pro!

The first thing to consider when playing blackjack is your betting strategy. In general, you should bet low when you have low cards and high when you have high cards. However, there is some flexibility with this rule – for example, if the dealer has a weak hand (e.g. a 2 or 3), you may want to increase your bet in order to win more money.

When it comes to playing your cards, remember that the ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what will help you get closer to 21. The second most important card is the queen – she’s worth 10 points. Other cards are worth their face value, with the exception of the jack (worth 10 points) and the two (worth 2 points).

If you have a total of 16 or lower, always hit (take another card). If you have 17-21, hit if the dealer has a card worth 4 or less; otherwise stand (don’t take any more cards). If you have 22 or more, always stand.

While it can be tempting to go all-in when you have a good hand, it’s important to remember that blackjack is a game of chance. Sometimes it’s better to take a smaller payout than risk losing everything – especially if the dealer has an ace up their sleeve!
