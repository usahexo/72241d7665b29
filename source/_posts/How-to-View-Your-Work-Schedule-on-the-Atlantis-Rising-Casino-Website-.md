#  Viewing My Work Schedule on the Atlantis Rising Casino Website 

This past weekend, I was able to take a look at my work schedule on the Atlantis Rising Casino website. I have to say that I was really pleased with what I saw. My shifts were evenly spaced out throughout the week, and there were plenty of days off so that I could enjoy myself. 

I work as a dealer at the casino, so it was nice to see that my shifts were scheduled for the times when the casino is busiest. This will ensure that I am able to make the most money possible while working. It was also great to see that my days off fell on the days when the casino is closed. This will give me plenty of time to relax and recharge my batteries. 

Overall, I am really happy with how my work schedule is currently set up. It seems like the casino has taken into account my needs and has scheduled me in a way that is best for me. I can't wait to start working and see how things go!
