#  Flowers in the Middle Reels for Bonus Picasso

The Museo Picasso in Malaga, Spain is home to a range of masterpieces from the renowned Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo Picasso. One such work on display is a series of 122 paintings known as the “Flowers in the Middle Reels”. This oft-overlooked set of pieces was created by Picasso in 1970 as part of a commission for the Set Design Department at the Royal Opera House in London.

However, due to political unrest at that time, the paintings never made it to London and were instead put on display in Malaga. The series is named after the reels of film that Picasso used as his canvas – he was an early adopter of new technologies and often used moving images as his source material.

The Flowers in the Middle Reels are a departure from Picasso’s usual style, featuring bright colours and playful designs. They depict scenes from everyday life, such as people boarding a bus or working in a factory. The paintings are currently undergoing restoration but are expected to be returned to the Museo Picasso in 2019.

If you’re ever in Malaga, make sure you stop by the museum to see these colourful and charming works by one of history’s most celebrated artists.
