#  Eagles Huge Favorites Heading into Divisional Round

The Philadelphia Eagles have been installed as six-point favorites against the Atlanta Falcons in next weekend’s Divisional Round matchup, according to odds released by Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook on Sunday.

Philadelphia is coming off of a bye week after dispatching the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game last weekend. The Falcons, meanwhile, upset the Los Angeles Rams in Wild Card Weekend.

It’s no surprise that the Eagles are overwhelming favorites heading into their matchup with Atlanta. Philly finished the season as the top seed in the NFC with a 13-3 record and possesses one of the league’s most explosive offenses. Led by quarterback Nick Foles, who has played exceptionally well in place of injured starter Carson Wentz, the Eagles scored an NFL-high 457 points during the regular season.

The Falcons, on the other hand, limped into the playoffs having lost three of their last four games. Atlanta’s offense has also struggled recently, averaging just 18.5 points per game over its last five contests.

Despite their poor form as of late, the Falcons still present a formidable challenge for Philadelphia. Atlanta boasts one of the league’s best wide receivers in Julio Jones and features a physical defense that can give opposing teams trouble.

With that said, it’s hard to see how Atlanta can beat Philadelphia – especially given how well Foles has been playing lately. Unless something unforeseen happens, expect Philadelphia to cruise to victory next weekend and advance to the NFC Championship Game.

Philadelphia Eagles Among Highest-Rated Teams in Vegas

The Philadelphia Eagles were one of the most talked about teams this offseason. Some labelled them Super Bowl contenders, others said they would miss the playoffs. However, it seems that the majority of Vegas sportsbook operators are siding with the Eagles.

As of right now, Philadelphia is listed as the fifth-highest rated team in Vegas to win this year’s Super Bowl, behind only the Patriots, Steelers, Falcons and Packers. The Eagles’ odds are set at 12-1, which puts them ahead of teams like the Cowboys (15-1) and Raiders (20-1).

While it’s always tough to tell how things will play out over the course of a season, it’s clear that Philly is one of the top teams in the league right now. Despite some key losses on defense (like Nolan Carroll and Bennie Logan), they still have a lot of talent on both sides of the ball.

Quarterback Carson Wentz had an impressive rookie season last year and should only continue to get better. And with receivers like Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith joining the team in free agency, the Eagles passing game should be one of the most feared in the NFL.

There are definitely some questions about this team – like their offensive line and secondary – but they appear to be much improved from last year. If everything falls into place, there’s no reason why they can’t make a run at the Super Bowl.

#  Eagles a Popular Bet Among Online Sportsbooks

The Philadelphia Eagles are a popular bet among online sportsbooks, as they have one of the best odds to win the Super Bowl this year. The Eagles are currently listed at 6-1 to win the Super Bowl, putting them behind only the New England Patriots (3-1) and the Green Bay Packers (8-1).

The Eagles had a strong 2017 season, finishing with a 13-3 record and winning the NFC East division title. Philadelphia is led by quarterback Carson Wentz, who had an MVP-caliber season in 2017. Wentz was injured late in the season but is expected to be ready for the start of the 2018 season.

The Eagles will face a tough test in the playoffs, as they will likely have to face either the Minnesota Vikings or New Orleans Saints in the NFC championship game. However, if they can make it to the Super Bowl, they could potentially upset the Patriots or Packers and win their first championship since 1960.

Online sportsbooks are expecting big things from Philadelphia this year, and that’s why they have such good odds to win the Super Bowl. If you’re looking for a potential dark horse pick to win this year’s championship, the Eagles should definitely be at the top of your list.

#  Why Are the Odds So High for the Philadelphia Eagles?

The Philadelphia Eagles have defied the odds by making it to the Super Bowl for the first time in 13 years. Their odds of winning are currently set at 18/1, which is considerably higher than the odds of any other team in the playoffs. So why are the Eagles such an underdog?

There are a few factors that contribute to this. First, the Eagles had a relatively weak schedule during the regular season. They only played two teams that made it to the playoffs (the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings). The Eagles also struggled earlier in the season, losing three out of their first six games.

Second, the Eagles don't have any big-name players. Quarterback Nick Foles is a good player, but he's not elite like Tom Brady or Ben Roethlisberger. The same can be said for most of the other players on the team. This lack of star power makes it difficult for people to get excited about them.

Finally, there's always been a stigma against Philly sports teams. The fans are known to be rowdy and interfere with games, which can make it difficult for teams from that area to win championships.
